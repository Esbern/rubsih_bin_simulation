# Default workshop configuration.
#
# For most workshops: keep this file committed, and put secrets in env vars.
# For other brokers: edit the mqtt.* fields (or create a separate config and load it).

mqtt:
  # HiveMQ Cloud is a common default.
  # Replace with your cluster host, e.g. "xxxxxx.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud".
  host: "c451c402b7fb41b399936cd5727a1d3f.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud"

  # For HiveMQ Cloud TLS MQTT the port is commonly 8883.
  port: 8883

  # Use TLS for cloud brokers.
  tls: true

  # Optional alternative if you connect via WebSockets instead of raw MQTT.

  # websocket_path: "/mqtt"

  # Use environment variables for credentials.

# Optional: rubbish-bin simulation configuration.

# If you omit this section, the template still works (config + MQTT helpers).
simulation:
  # One timestep = 15 minutes (as documented in README.md)

  # Optional: fixed simulation start time (UTC) for deterministic logs/plots.
  # If omitted, the simulator uses the current wall-clock time.

  # Optional: emit a status event on every deposit (more frequent logs/graphs)
  # publish_every_deposit: true

  # Optional: wall-clock delay between timesteps (useful for MQTT testing)
  step_delay_s: 0.1

  # Optional: set to a fixed integer to make runs reproducible
